# Input data

MiGA datasets can be created from three different points:
[Raw reads](#raw-reads), [Trimmed reads](#trimmed-reads), and
[Assemblies](#assemblies). In addition, MiGA accepts
[other types of data](#other-types-of-input) for other purposes, such as
metadata.

## Raw reads



## Trimmed reads

## Assemblies

Ideally, but not necessarily, only contigs longer than 1 Kbp.

## Other types of Input
